**Multimodal Housing Price Prediction**
This project implements a multimodal machine learning system that combines both structured data and house images to predict housing prices. The solution uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and combines them with tabular data for improved prediction accuracy.

**Features**
Multimodal Learning: Combines structured data and image data for housing price prediction

CNN Feature Extraction: Uses pre-trained VGG16 model to extract features from house images

Feature Fusion: Combines image features with structured data features

Performance Evaluation: Uses MAE and RMSE metrics to evaluate model performance

Comparative Analysis: Compares multimodal approach with single-modality baselines

**Requirements**
Python 3.7+

TensorFlow 2.12.0+

scikit-learn 1.2.0+

pandas 1.5.0+

---

**Installation**
Clone this repository:
git clone (https://github.com/Nasir-Raza-AI/House_Price_Prediction)
cd House_Price_Prediction

**Install the required packages:**
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install packages individually:
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn Pillow

---

**Usage**
Run the main script to generate synthetic data, train models, and evaluate performance:
python multimodal_housing.py
The script will:

Generate synthetic structured housing data

Create synthetic house images for demonstration

Preprocess and scale the data

Build and train the multimodal model

Evaluate model performance using MAE and RMSE

Compare results with single-modality baselines

---

**Model Architecture**
The multimodal model consists of two branches:

**Image Branch:**

Uses pre-trained VGG16 as a feature extractor

Global Average Pooling layer

Fully connected layers with dropout

**Structured Data Branch:**

Multiple dense layers with dropout

Processes numerical features (square footage, bedrooms, etc.)

---

**Fusion:**

Concatenates features from both branches

Final regression layers for price prediction

---

**Results**
The model provides:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in dollars

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in dollars

Comparison with structured-data-only and image-only baselines

Visualization of training history and prediction accuracy

---

**Customization**
To use with your own data:

Replace the synthetic data generation with your actual housing dataset

Replace the synthetic image creation with loading of real house images

Adjust the model architecture based on your specific data characteristics

---

**Key Techniques**
Transfer Learning (VGG16 for image feature extraction)

Feature Fusion (combining different data modalities)

Data Preprocessing and Scaling

Regularization (Dropout)

Early Stopping and Learning Rate Reduction

---

**Future Enhancements**
Add attention mechanisms for improved feature weighting

Implement more advanced architectures (Transformers, ResNet)

Add hyperparameter optimization

Include explainability features (SHAP, LIME)

Deploy as a web application
